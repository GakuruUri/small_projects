1. Bagels has a bug in the code.
   - Improvements:

        Clearer Variable Naming: Uses secret_num for consistency and readability.
        Docstring Enhancements: Adds comments explaining the purpose of each function.
        Unique Digits Handling: Ensures the secret number has unique digits using a set.
        Efficient Digit Choice: Uses set.add() to check if a digit is unique before adding it.
        Optional Clue Sorting: Comments out clue sorting as it might reveal positional information.
        Case-Insensitive Input: Handles "yes" or "YES" for play-again prompt.
        Concise Code: Removes unnecessary comments and whitespace.
        This refined code offers a more robust, user-friendly, and well-documented Bagels game experience.
